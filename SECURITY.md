## Torn - Key

The keys will be treated as stated in our privacy policy (PP).
Your key is saved by your browser using simple encryption, it is persistent and will only be deleted when you click the delete button or delete your browsing data. You are responsible for your API key. The use of malicious extensions installed intentionally or accidentally is exempt from our responsibility.

## Code security

Saving and accessing the API is done offline, and if you have a system for automatically forming calls to TORN, it will NEVER be sent to a third-party API, it will always be handled only and exclusively in our system.

We do not have any server or API that can access data from another machine, that is, all data collected from you is non-transferable and inaccessible by other users and developers.
