[Sanallite](https://github.com/sanallite) | Created the core API design

## How Use

After downloaded the LTS in [releases](https://github.com/Eloazy/EmberSlave/releases)

Unzip the file and look for a file called `pre-install` and click, a black screen will appear and disappear quickly, this means that it has successfully created the easly starter. (you only need make this one time per update installed)

Go to `API useful` and start `run_server` After he gives you the credits he will ask you to click on the EmberSlave file which will be the API

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These steps must be followed strictly for the API to work correctly, the server in `run_server` must always be started and cannot be closed while using the APP.
